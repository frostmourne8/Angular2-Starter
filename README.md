# Epic user management
The answer to question #3 on the epic tech screen

## Dependencies
The only required global dependency is node. All other dependencies will be installed by NPM.

## Installing
Running the command below will install all required dependencies and get you ready for launching the application
```bash
npm install
```
## Running the application
After you have installed the required dependencies you can launch the application in development mode or build it for production

## Balance API
In addition to the application, there is an exposed endpoint for manipulating a user's currency balance. The endpoint is at **PUT ../users/:id/balance**.
The expected body is json of the format **{ "balance": *amount* }**. The amount can be negative to reduce the balance.

### Start development mode
The command below will launch both the node backend and a webpack development server that will dynamically compile and serve the application resources.
```bash
npm start
```
You can then navigate to <http://localhost:9000/webpack-dev-server> to launch the application

### Production build
The command below will build and package the application for deployment. The production artifacts will be output to the **dist** directory
```bash
npm run build
```

## Testing
There are three layers of testing in this project:

* _Unit tests_ - The lowest level tests. Typically tests at the function level and ignores the existence of Angular.
* _Component tests_ - Loads individual components and tests them in isolation. Tests are driven through fixture classes that manipulate the DOM.
* _Service tests_ - Tests the backend node services

The tests can be run in various modes:

The full suite with coverage
```bash
npm run test
```

The ui tests in watch mode
```bash
npm run test:ui
```

The server tests in watch mode
```bash
npm run test:server
```

The ui tests with coverage
```bash
npm run test-coverage:ui
```

The server tests with coverage
```bash
npm run test-coverage:server
```

### Coverage
Test coverage will be reported in the console after each test run, and a detailed report will be output to the **coverage** directory
